### High-Level Overview
1. [What type of information do we need?](https://github.com/Coding-Bz/BLJ2025_AA_Eli_Abi_Luk/blob/main/01_documentation/01_inform/inform.md#1-what-type-of-information-do-we-need)  
2. [General information needed](https://github.com/Coding-Bz/BLJ2025_AA_Eli_Abi_Luk/blob/main/01_documentation/01_inform/inform.md#2-general-information-needed)  
3. [Tools and Software](https://github.com/Coding-Bz/BLJ2025_AA_Eli_Abi_Luk/blob/main/01_documentation/01_inform/inform.md#3-tools-and-software)  

## 1. What Type of Information Do We Need?

**Dates**  
- Deadlines and due dates for presentations and assignment submission.  

**Deliverables**  
- What needs to be delivered? Where and in what format?  
- Requirements for documentation and its presentation.  

**Tools**  
- Tracking the necessary tools for the project.  

## 2. General Information Needed
This list provides a comprehensive overview of the general information required for the assignment.  

### Dates
- The project starts on February 20, 2025  
- The project ends on February 28, 2025, at 10:00 AM 

### Deliverables
- A documentation following the IPERKA method, with a focus on I, P, and K  
  - A suitable format is required (cover page, table of contents)  
- The final result must be presented  
  - The presentation format is open, but it must last 12 minutes (tolerance: ±2 minutes)  
  - It must include:  
    - Overview  
    - Documentation  
    - Work distribution  
    - Brief insight into the source code  
    - Important code snippet and a reflection  

### Knowledge Requirements
- We need to ensure the team knows their preferred way of working together  
- The I and P phases are essential  
  - Starting coding too early could affect the final outcome  
  - Text descriptions leave room for interpretation a reference source should be provided  
- No fixed role assignment:  
  - Each member will program a class  
- Documentation writing will be divided:  
    - One person will write I and P  
    - Another will write Realize Phase  
    - Another will write Decision and Control Phase 
    - The Assess Phase will be written together  

### Assignment Guidelines & Instructions
- Understanding how a snack vending machine works in reality  
- Working with appropriate classes  
- Creating a UML diagram  
- Identifying error scenarios (e.g., insufficient money for a snack, out-of-stock items)  

### Collaboration and Group Work Guidelines
- All teammates must contribute sufficiently, which should be visible in commits  
  - We will commit to our features when making a significant change  
  - For development, commits will be made once a class is completed  
- Commit quality is important  
- Team members must be able to work simultaneously on the documentation 
  - Documentation is stored on GitHub for accessibility 
- Commit messages must be meaningful and consistent within the group  
  - Every 2 hours, a commit must be made following this structure:  
    - Week-Keyword_Noun_Verb → Example: `08-Admin_Structure_CodeUpdate`  

### Evaluation and Feedback
- The documentation and code must be accessible on GitHub  
  - The GitHub account should be created by one team member  
  - All trainers must be added as collaborators  

## 3. Tools and Software

**Visual Studio Code**  
- Used to work on documentation and code in parallel.  
- [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  

**GitHub Desktop**  
- Used to manage commits and track progress.  
- [Download GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/)  

**Excel**

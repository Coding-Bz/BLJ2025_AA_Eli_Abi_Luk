## 1. Brainstorming
* We ensured that everyone would contribute to the branch input so that the entire team could benefit
* We gathered together and discussed potential errors that might appear during the project
* A question was posed into the group and each member shared their opinion. We debated the various options and selected the most effective solution
* Our discussion was recorded so that it could be referenced during the documentation (decision phase)

## 2. Resource Plan
We planned the following:
* A total of 87 hours was dedicated to the vending machine project
  * On Thursday, 20.02.2025 at 13:15, we received the project assignment and completed the information-gathering and planning phase by 17:00
  * On Friday, 21.02.2025, final decisions were made in the morning and by 12:00, we familiarized ourselves with branching strategies
  * From Wednesday to Thursday, 27.02.2025, programming was planned and the control phase was completed
  * On Friday, 28.02.2025, the documentation was finalized, the code was pushed to the main branch, and the presentation was completed

* Although we had the same submission deadline, our working hours differed (8h vs. 8.4h), which affected individual schedules
* Additionally, progress meetings took place during the week, leading to Elif contributing 26 hours to the project, because in the group she had to go to this meeting

## 4. Task List
* To ensure clarity, we documented the task list on Notion and shared the folder with the team
* Since everyone had access, we updated the list dynamically for instance, if two people worked on a task instead of one
* The task list was reviewed at least twice a day. Any modifications were immediately visible and email notifications were sent automatically
* Tasks were divided into programming and documentation categories for better organization

## 5. Managing the Task List
* If we noticed that a task changed or took longer than expected, we adjusted the plan accordingly
* Each team member managed their tasks independently in the way that suited them best
  * Some used handwritten notes, while others utilized Microsoft To-Do with time allocations
* Tasks were continuously prioritized based on effort and importance, ensuring that must-have requirements were met first

## 6. Must and Can Goals
We applied the IPERKA method to categorize must-have and can goals

Must Goals:
* Insert money and select a product using a unique product number
* Receive change after purchase
* Cancel the purchase at any time and receive the full amount back
* Use a secret key for maintenance tasks:
  * Restocking snacks
  * Adjusting prices
  * Replacing products
  * The vending machine starts empty and an initial stock can be added using the secret key

Can Goals:
* Ability to adjust prices for all or individual items

## 7. Monitoring Progress
* Every morning, we held a short 10-minute meeting to discuss our goals for the day. Another follow-up meeting was held in the afternoon.
* We compared Actual Effort vs. Estimated Effort to track progress
  * If we fell behind schedule, we documented the issue in Notion made necessary adjustments and informed the team (per teams or personal)

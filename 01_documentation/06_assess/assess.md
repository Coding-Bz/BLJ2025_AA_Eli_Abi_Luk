## What went well?
In our opinion, the group work and communication couldn't have been any better. We are really satisfied with the way we organized everything.

## What didn't go planned?

Sometimes, we had to make quick changes due to time constraints, which was a bit stressful, but that’s something that could be improved in the next group project. Additionally, some of us unexpectedly had to work on the Bildungsbericht at certain times, so we had to remain flexible.


# Reflection


**Reflection of Elif**

The first decision already starts with choosing the group, and the more time I spend working with the group, the more I realized that this was an extremely good decision. Regarding teamwork, we all supported each other and ensured that everyone did approximately the same amount of work. Regarding communication, we repeatedly had short meetings to update all team members and a long meeting at the beginning as well as at the end. I found this extremely pleasant because it allowed all of us to build our own part as well as possible without much stress. As for the final result as discussed from the beginning, we wanted to focus more on quality rather than the number of different features, and in my opinion, we achieved that. Our code meets the requirements of the Definition of Done. I was also responsible for Money Maintenance and Menu. The more you test, the more you understand the gaps in the program. In my opinion, I was able to fill these gaps very effectively and ensure a good user experience. Also, in terms of content, it was very diverse because everyone worked on everything each person had their own part in the code but also a part in the documentation. And I could also learn a lot from others because we all had a different style of coding.

I was responsible for the Admin class and worked on both the information and planning phases. Additionally, I supported the team with the test cases. I believe I was able to make a valuable contribution to the project.However, I see room for improvement in the quality of my code. Code was written on Friday, and when I reviewed it on Wednesday, February 26, 2025, I made some changes. I improved its user-friendliness and implemented a menu using a switch-case structure. This made me realize that there are different approaches to programming. Especially when putting yourself in the user’s perspective and considering how to make the application as simple as possible for them, the quality of the code can be significantly improved. believe our teamwork was very successful, as we maintained good communication. Overall, I am satisfied with my contribution and have gained valuable insights that will help me in future projects.

**Reflection of Luka**
Personally, I am very satisfied with our teamwork. We had great communication and were able to realize the project together. Everyone did their part. To be honest, I found that I did the least. But I don't take that too badly. I was still able to do a bit of everything and I didn't work any less than the others. There's not such a big gap between me and the others. I think our program is great. We were able to write the code cleanly and logically. The program itself ran well. I'm a bit proud of it.
We were able to master all IPERKA phases. The planning went well. Together we were able to create a good sequence for the machine and divide up the orders between us. The control phase was also structured, and we were able to ensure that everything worked as it should. I don't have any major criticism of our group work that we could improve next time. I thought we did a pretty good job.

# Design

### High-Level Overview
1. Brainstorming
2. Define file structure
3. Design the Github directory structure
4. Flowchart Gameplay
5. Character Yoda
6. Platforms design stones
7. Design game
8. Test cases

## Brainstorming
* We created a sketch to have an overview of what to include in the realization phase.

 
## Structure of the Files
* Create repository
* Created the files on gitHub with naming conventions.
* Folder structure:
  * 01_Documentation (IPERKA phases)
  * 02_Code
  * under documentation 02_References (subfolders: Drawio, Excel, Images, Videos)
* Use numbered structure for better organization
* Collaborate with team member and teacher to share issues

## Github directory structure
* We defined the directory structure of our repository.

## Flowchart Gameplay
For our project, we created a flowchart with drawio that maps out the entire gameplay process, from the game's start to its conclusion.
 
### Importance of our flowchart
**Clarity** 
  * The flowchart makes the gameplay clear and easy to understand, even for those who aren't directly involved in the programming.
 
**Planning** 
  * Before we start coding, the flowchart helps us plan all the important steps and decisions in the game, allowing us to identify potential problems early on.
 
**Communication** 
  * The flowchart serves as a common ground for the entire team.
 
**Error Prevention** 
  * By visually representing the flow of the game, we can spot and fix logical errors before they become bigger problems.

## Player
* We got the image from the internet (resource in the [informing phase](https://github.com/hacker5ele/Cosmic-BYoda-/blob/main/01_Documentation/01_iperka/01_inform/01_inform%20Cosmic%20BYoda.md)).

## Platforms 
* The stones are the platforms where Yoda jumps on, we got them from the internet (resource in the [informing phase](https://github.com/hacker5ele/Cosmic-BYoda-/blob/main/01_Documentation/01_iperka/01_inform/01_inform%20Cosmic%20BYoda.md)).
 
Example: [Stones](https://github.com/hacker5ele/Cosmic-BYoda-/tree/main/01_Documentation/02_references/images/13_Stones)

## Design game
* A digital sketch of our game was made so we both have a clear idea of how we imagine it.

## Possible Test cases 
* We wrote down a few test cases that we expect our game to go through. 
* It was actualized October, 22.2024, the red marks are signalizing that we are not going to do the task (Reason: [Plan adjustment](https://github.com/hacker5ele/Cosmic-BYoda-/blob/main/01_Documentation/01_iperka/02_plan/Planning.md)).

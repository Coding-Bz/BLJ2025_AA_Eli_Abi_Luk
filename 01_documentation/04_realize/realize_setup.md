# Setup

### High-Level 
1. Team Communication
2. Setting Up GitHub Repository
3. Creating File Structure
4. Connecting IntelliJ IDEA to the Repository
5. Creating Branches
6. Performing Test Commits

## 1. Team Communication
* We ensured that every morning, as soon as everyone arrived at work, we held a meeting
  * This allowed us to stay updated on recent changes and synchronize our progress
* We created a Teams chat to stay connected throughout the project
* Whenever someone needed help, we took the time to assist each other

## 2. Setting Up GitHub Repository
* Created a new repository on GitHub: [BLJ2025_AA_Eli_Abi_Luk](https://github.com/Coding-Bz/BLJ2025_AA_Eli_Abi_Luk)

## 3. Creating File Structure
* Established the file structure on GitHub using consistent naming conventions
* Folder structure:
  * **01_Documentation** (IPERKA phases)
  * **02_References**
  * **03_Code**
  * Subfolders under References: Presentation, Excel, Images, Drawio
* Used a numbered structure for better organization
* Collaborated with team members and the teacher to address any issues

## 4. Connecting IntelliJ IDEA to the Repository
* Opened the repository in IntelliJ IDEA

## 5. Creating Branches
We created the following branches:
  * **main**
  * **development** (Major updates were pushed here before merging into the main branch)
    * **money_maintenance_elif** (Menu and money management)
    * **feature_admin_abigail** (Admin regulations)
    * **feature_item_luka** (Item control)

* Each team member worked on their respective feature branch until completion before merging into the development branch
* Once the project was finalized, we merged the development branch into the main branch

## 6. Performing Test Commits
* We conducted initial test commits to ensure smooth collaboration (commits were labeled as tests)
* Additionally, we performed test merges to understand the merging process

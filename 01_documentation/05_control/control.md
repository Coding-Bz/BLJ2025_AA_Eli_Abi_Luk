# Control

**Intro**

The control phase was an important phase for us because we really tried to bring the program to 
the point where we could control the whole thing. That’s why we took the time to seriously consider 
the improvement suggestions and actually implement new features and more control phases into our program. 
For our control method, we used white box, black box, and grey box testing, so that’s the reason why 
you are going to find in this chapter not only our feedback for improvement but also feedback from two 
other students who didn’t take part in this project. All the document about the control phase are in this chapter.
